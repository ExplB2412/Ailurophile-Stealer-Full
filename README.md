## ⚙️ Requirements

This project is very lightweight and primarily based on **XAMPP** as the main web stack. Setup is designed to be semi-automated, but manual adjustments might be required.

### ✅ Tools & Dependencies

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) — Main web server environment  
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) — Database engine (included in XAMPP)  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)  
- [rcedit](https://github.com/electron/rcedit)  
- [ExeOutput for PHP 2024](https://www.exeoutput.com/)  

Make sure all tools are properly added to your system **PATH**.

## 🛠️ Setup Notes

- Most dependencies will auto-load when needed.  
- If something fails, check for missing libraries or paths.  
- **Check all `config.php` files and update database credentials as needed** — the system uses **MySQL**.  
- **Use `localhost.sql` to create the MySQL database schema.**  
- **The folder `gobinandpackage/` contains necessary binaries used in V2.**  
- Use the included `.bat` files as entry points — they often chain commands and reveal which components are required.  
- If you encounter errors, debug carefully and **install only what's missing**.  
- The repo is loosely assembled from prior versions — it's **not guaranteed to be clean or complete**.
